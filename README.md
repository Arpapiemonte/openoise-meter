TERM OF  USE: 
This app is not intended for professional use, it does not necessarily guarantee an accurate noise measurement.
Since each device has a different response to noise, a comparison with a professional noise level meter in the measurement dynamic range is required.
The utilization of the app requires adequate technical knowledge and skill; an extemporary measurement might not be correct.
